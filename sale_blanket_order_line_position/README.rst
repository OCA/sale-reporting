This module adds an auto computed position on blanket order line.
This position number is also printed on the report.

The position can be used to keep track of each line during
the sales , the delivery and invoicing of the order with the customer.
This is why it depends on `sale_order_line_position` and there are related modules on:
- `account-invoice-reporting`
- `stock-logisics-reporting`

The positions are recomputed when the blanket order is printed, sent and set to confirm.

The positions are not changed on the line after the blanket order has been confirmed, but if
new line are added they will receive a position number.

An action is also availabled to manually recompute the positions.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

The way the positions are computed on the create of `sale.blanket.order.line`
record could lead to a performance issue. There is a few improvements
that have been suggested:

Remove it and handle the computation on the write and/or create
method of the `sale.blanket.order`.

NB: the handling is the same than into the module `sale_order_line_position`. It should
be fixed in both modules

Have a context key to enable/disable the recomputation.

Do not set any value in the position fields before the sale blanket order lines
are locked (in the current implementation, before sending).
And add a recompute button in the UI.

Set the position values with an SQL query using a `TRIGGER`.
