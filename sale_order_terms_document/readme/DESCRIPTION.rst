This modules extends the functionality of sale order by adding terms and conditions in PDF format.
When terms and conditions are selected on a sale order, 2 things will happen :
#. When printing sale order, PDF of terms and conditions will be inserted at the end of sale order generated PDF
#. When using online signature for this sale order, in signature popup it will add a link to terms and conditions (in section "By signing this proposal, I agree to the following terms:")
