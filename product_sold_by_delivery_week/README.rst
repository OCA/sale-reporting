This module allows to compute a graphical hint, stored in the product itself,
to display whether that product was sold and delivered in recent weeks.

Configuration
=============

Some variables can be configured using config parameter keys:

- For hint characters:

 - For the sold char: `product_sold_by_delivery_week.sold_char`
 - For the not sold: `product_sold_by_delivery_week.not_sold_char`
 - For weeks length: `product_sold_by_delivery_week.weeks_to_consider`

Assign the security group 'Weekly selling info in order lines' and/or
'Weekly selling info in product list' to users that should see weekly
sales info in product lists or in order lines. (If you want to see the
info in other views like product recommendations, this is not needed.)

Usage
=====

Once configured, hints will apperar as an optional column in sale order
lines or in products tree.

In the general products view, general sales info is shown. Meanwhile, in the
sale lines field we can see this field in context by simply filtering partner
sales.

Only salespeople can access this information.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Services are not taken into consideration.
* A widget could be created on top of the main field to have nicer icons and
  probably colors.
* For the near future, a configurable granularity would be desirable, so
  behaviour could be changed to years, months or days as the period of choice.
  To simplify this module, only weekly periods will be considered for now.
