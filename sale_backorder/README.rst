Overview
========
This module adds the ability to view UIGD and Backordered products on Sales Oders.
The quantity and the value of both UIGD and Backordered products is computed for
sales order lines and then aggregated for display on the parent sales order.

Usage
=====
Install the module. In the sales module, under the Sales menu, select the 
SO Lines and Backorders menu option. This will display a tree view of all sale order lines
with their UIGD and Backorder information as well as the last date delivered and the
last date billed. Use the Backorders report menu to print a report.
