In some cases you may offer a customer a free service or product as part of the Quotation / Sale Order. You want to keep it in Quotation / Sale Order to be able to calculate margin but it should not appear to the customer on the PDF report of their Quotation / Sale Order.

This module allows you to hide sale order lines from the PDF report if the unit price is 0.
