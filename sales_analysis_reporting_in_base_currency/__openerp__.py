Sales analysis reporting in base currency
=========================================
When you have several invoices, Odoo displays the
total amounts for a defined period in the Reporting
Module, Sales Analysis entry. This total is wrong
if you have made sales in different currencies as
Odoo ignores currencies in this instance.

This module therefore allows the system to assign a
converted amount in the default company currency
and associates it to a sale.order made in a
different currency. The rate is chosen when the
sales order is set to done.

The sales analysis reporting tool is therefore
modified to present a consistent total for your
sales in your base currency.
