subtotal' flags in *Sale order section lines* and *Customer invoice
section lines* if you want to show or hide their lines or their
subtotals in the PDF report and in the website. You can also show or
hide the section subtotal and line amount by checking or unchecking the
new 'Show section subtotal' and 'Show line amount' flags.

   OCA/web because until now this widget has not been needed for
   anything else, but it's good that in the future that would be done.
